## Electric Vehicles Trends in Washington State

### Abstract

In 2011, the United States sold just over 16,000 battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. That
number had increased by a factor of a hundred by December 2020, to approximately 1.7 million
automobiles. By the middle of 2021, total sales of plug-in electric vehicles had topped 2 million. We
have narrowed down particularly to the state of Washington’s EV sales data from 2017 to 2021. The
aim of our investigation firstly is to analyze the sales trend over the years, company and model wise
sales distribution and secondly we are looking into factors like reduction in cost of renewable energy
source which have either led to or affected the rise in EV sales, thus drawing a correlation between
them and concluding based on the analysis.

### Introduction
Between 2010 and 2020, the electric car market in
the United States grew from a few thousand
vehicles to over 315,000 vehicles sold yearly.
Electric vehicles accounted for about 2.4 percent of
new car sales in 2020, up from nearly 2 percent in
2019.
States with ZEV legislation had a combined new
electric car share of 5% and at least 13 more electric
models available than states without such
regulations, which had a 1.3 percent average
electric vehicle share. ZEV-required states
accounted for around two-thirds of electric vehicle
sales in 2020, but less than one-third of overall
light-duty vehicle sales.
The growth of renewable energy will have a
significant impact on electric vehicle sales. In 2021,
$105 billion in additional private capital will be
invested in the US energy transition, an increase of
11% year over year and 70% over the previous five
years. Clean energy received $47 billion (45
percent), electrified transportation received $35
billion (34 percent), and hydrogen investments
doubled to $200 million in 2021. Furthermore, the
US grid installed nearly 4.2 GW of battery capacity
in 2021, more than in the previous five years
combined. This was due to the increased demand
for batteries brought on by the rise of renewable
energy, particularly solar.
EVs currently account for about 2 to 3% of the
annual new-vehicle market, despite their
exponential rise. Passenger car fleets typically last
20 years, whereas truck fleets last 25 years. Even
under the most hopeful scenarios, the shift to
electric vehicles will be gradual. By 2025, new
electric vehicle sales will have a minor impact on
overall emissions, but they will become
increasingly essential in the decades ahead. During
this long-term transition, continued gains in
gasoline vehicle fuel efficiency are crucial to
reducing GHG emissions. Vehicle cost—especially
for bigger vehicles—and public charging
technology and availability are significant
impediments to more broad adoption of EVs.
Government initiatives and ongoing innovation will
be critical in accelerating the transition to electric
vehicles.

### Project Development Methodology
● The project structure and timeline was
discussed during in-person meetings and
3
accordingly set up on ConceptBoard. We
followed fibonacci’s agile methodology.

● The tasks created in Conceptboard were
assigned to team members on Jira board and
after each sprint we had project update
meetings. ( 1 sprint = 2 weeks )

● Github was used for version control and
source code management.

● We used python libraries like Pandas for
data cleaning and processing

● Data modeling and ER diagrams were
modeled on draw.io.

● Data visualization is done by using Tableau.

● The use of pair programming has enhanced
the project's time management for
development and testing.

● Using this strategy, fostering teamwork
among the team was also quite simple. We
can state that adopting a pair programming
approach alongside development has had a
very favorable impact on the project
outcome.

### Conclusion

Electric vehicles (EVs) have yet to achieve
widespread adoption at scale, despite gaining
widespread awareness in a short period of time.
Cost is one of the most significant barriers to
mainstream EV adoption. The cost of purchasing an
electric vehicle is the main worry for 67 percent of
consumers. These fears are well-founded: an EV
can cost anywhere from 10% to over 40% more
than a comparable gasoline-only car. However,
early adopters, on the other hand, have reacted
positively to the many advantages of electric
vehicles, including lower lifetime costs, better
performance, and a less carbon footprint. Lower
operating expenses, along with lower up-front
expenditures, make EVs more appealing to a wider
range of customers, particularly low-income
drivers. Currently, transportation expenditures form
a substantial part of overall household expenses,
and with this more inexpensive, accessible choice,
low-income households will most benefit from
these reductions.
